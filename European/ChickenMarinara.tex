Heat 4 tablespoons olive oil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. 
Add garlic and shallots and sauté until tender, about 4 minutes. 
Add tomatoes, oregano, and crushed red pepper. 
Simmer until sauce thickens, about 10 minutes. 
Mix in basil and season to taste with salt and pepper. 
Set aside.

Blend breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese in small bowl. 
Place flour and eggs in separate shallow bowls. 
Coat chicken with flour, then eggs, then breadcrumb mixture.

Preheat oven to 350°. 

Heat remaining oil in heavy large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.
Working in batches if necessary, add chicken and sauté until golden brown and cooked through, about 4 minutes per side.
Place chicken pieces on an oven-proof serving dish. 
Spoon sauce over chicken pieces. Sprinkle with Mozzarella cheese. 
Bake for 10 minutes, or microwave on high heat for 10-20 seconds, just until the cheese has melted.
