If you are making a crust from scratch, prepare the dough and let it chill in the refrigerator while 
you are cooking the onions.

Peel and slice the onions.
Heat olive oil and butter in a large, heavy-bottomed sauté pan on medium heat. 
Once the butter has melted, add the onions and sprinkle a little salt over them. 
Cook, stirring occasionally for 10 minutes, until the onions have softened and are translucent. 
Reduce the heat to medium low and cook for an additional 40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until 
the onions are well browned. Add balsamic vinegar and cook for 10 minutes more, until onions are 
completely caramelized. Remove from heat.

Preheat the oven to 450°F. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let stand for 5 minutes before
rolling it out. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to a 10-inch diameter. 
Remove the crust dough to a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.

Place all but a couple tablespoons of the cheese in the center of the dough. 
Spread to within 1\sfrac{1}{2} inches from the edges. Add the caramelized onions, layering them on 
top of the cheese. Fold the edges of the crust dough over so that a small circle of onion is still 
showing in the centre of the tart. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the top of the tart.

Place in the oven on the middle rack. Bake for 10 minutes at 450°F. Reduce the heat to 350°F and 
bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, until the crust is golden brown. Remove from oven and let sit 
for 10 minutes before serving.
