Punch the dough down and knead again for about 90 seconds. Just to get the air out of the dough. Take the dough and squeeze it top to bottom making it into a long snake shape. Making sure the dough snake is about 2 inches in diameter. Cut into small 2x2 dough piece and flatten it with your hands into a round shape. Roll out thin about 5 inches in diameter, again making sure the outer dough is slightly thinner than the center. Place filling in the center. Pinch pleat dough so that all the edges come to top center and the bun is round with a swirl design on top. Make certain the center is closed tightly. Sprinkle chives or black seasme on top and let it rest for 10 min.(covered with a dry towel) then place in a pan and cook.
