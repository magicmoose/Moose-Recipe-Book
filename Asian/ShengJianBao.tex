Mix all of the ingredients except cabbage with a mixer or your fingers (the old Chinese way) for a good 3-4 minutes until the meat has broken down into a smooth mixture and not chunks. 

Drain the salted cabbage and rise with cold water. After the cabbage is rinsed, squeeze out any excess water with all of your might! Make sure the cabbage is dry or else the filling will just fall apart. 

Add the chopped, rinsed, and dried cabbage into the meat mixture and mix well. 

Open the packaged rolls; take one of the rolls out and roll it with a rolling pin. It should be around 4 inches in diameter, make sure the edges are thinner than the center. This will help when you pinch the seams together. Fill the center of the dough with 1 \sfrac{1}{2} tablespoon of the filling. Carefully pinch edges together to seal dough around filling. It doesn't have to be perfect, but make sure it is sealed tight or else the jucies will escape during cooking.

Put 1 Tbsp of oil in a flat non-stick pan. Placed the wrapped buns in a non-stick pan and turn on the heat. Pour 1 \sfrac{1}{3} cups of cold water and a few drops of rice vinegar into the pan, cook on high heat covered until all of the water has evaporated and you can hear the pan sizzle (Should be around 20 min).
