Cut the chicken into bite-sized cubes (about 1-inch). Add the marinade ingredients. Marinate the chicken for 20 minutes.

While the chicken is marinating, prepare the remainder of the ingredients. In a large saucepan, cook the noodles in boiling water, stirring to separate, until they are tender, but still firm. Drain thoroughly. Rinse with cold water, drain again, and toss with the sesame oil.

Wash and finely shred the cabbage. Peel and mince the garlic. Cut the green onion on the diagonal into 1-inch pieces.

In a heavy frying pan or a wok, heat 2 \sfrac{1}{2} tablespoons oil over medium-high to high heat. When the oil is hot, add the garlic. Stir-fry until aromatic (about 30 seconds). Add the chicken cubes. Stir-fry until they turn white and are nearly cooked through. Remove from the wok. 

Heat 2 tablespoons oil. When the oil is hot, add the cabbage. Stir-fry for 2 minutes. Season with a bit of soy sauce and/or sugar while stir-frying if desired. Remove from the wok.

Heat 1 \sfrac{1}{2} tablespoons oil in the wok. When the oil is hot, add the noodles. Stir-fry quickly, stirring to coat the noodles in the oil and make sure they don't stick to the pan. Add the hoisin sauce, again tossing to coat the noodles. Taste and add salt and/or soy sauce as desired. Add the cooked chicken and cabbage. Add the green onion and stir to heat through. Serve hot.
