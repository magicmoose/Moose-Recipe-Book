Note that the smaller you chop your vegetables, the faster they will cook. 
We like to finely dice the onion. celery and carrot, and cut the squash and apple into \sfrac{1}{2}-inch chunks.
Squash and Apple should be in 3:1 ratio.

Set a large saucepan over medium-high heat and heat the butter for 1-2 minutes. 
Do not let it turn brown. Add the onion, celery and carrot and saut√© for 5 minutes, taking care to 
turn the heat down if the vegetables begin to brown.

Add squash, apple, broth and water. Bring to boil. Cover, turn the heat down to a simmer and cook 
for 30 minutes or until squash and carrots soften. Puree, and return to a clean pot.

Add salt and spices to taste, and garnish with chives or parsley.
