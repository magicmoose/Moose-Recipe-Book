Butter 4 individual ramekins or small baking dishes (round or oval). 
Break 2 eggs in each dish.

Prosciutto (trimmed to the size of the ramekin). 
Place cheese on top and bake in an oven at 375 degrees until cheese is melted.

Eggs can be cooked more or less on top of the stove or in the oven if you desire them to be firmer and then topped.
