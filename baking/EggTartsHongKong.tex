In a medium bowl, mix together the powdered sugar and flour. 

Mix in butter with a fork until it is in small crumbs. 

Stir in the egg and vanilla until the mixture forms a dough. 
The texture should be slightly moist. Add more butter if it is too dry, or more flour, if the dough seems greasy. 

Shape dough into 1\sfrac{1}{2} inch balls, and press the balls into tart molds so that it covers the bottom, and goes up higher than the sides. 
Use 2 fingers to shape the edge into an A shape.

Preheat the oven to 350 \degree F.

Combine the white sugar and water in a medium saucepan, and bring to a boil. 

Cook until the sugar is dissolved, remove from heat and cool to room temperature. 

Strain the eggs through a sieve, and whisk into the sugar mixture. 
Stir in the evaporated milk and vanilla. 
 
Strain the filling through a sieve, and fill the tart shells about \sfrac{3}{4}.

Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown, and the filling is puffed up a little bit.
